### Cold Email Sequence

#### Email 1: Initial Outreach
```
Subject Lines (A/B Test):
A: Quick question about {{company}}'s {{pain_point}}
B: {{first_name}}, noticed you're scaling {{specific_metric}}

Hi {{first_name}},

I noticed {{personalized_observation}} - congrats on {{recent_achievement}}!

Many {{industry}} companies we work with struggle with {{specific_pain_point}}, especially when {{trigger_event}}.

We helped {{similar_company}} {{specific_result}} in just {{timeframe}}.

Worth a quick chat to see if we could do something similar for {{company}}?

{{sender_name}}

P.S. {{relevant_resource}} might be helpful regardless.
```

#### Email 2: Value Add (Day 3)
```
Subject: {{first_name}}, thought you'd find this useful

Hi {{first_name}},

Just wanted to share a quick case study on how {{similar_company}} solved {{pain_point}}:

• Challenge: {{specific_challenge}}
• Solution: {{brief_solution}}
• Result: {{quantified_outcome}}

The full breakdown is here: {{case_study_link}}

If this resonates, I'd be happy to share how we could adapt this for {{company}}.

{{sender_name}}
```

#### Email 3: Social Proof (Day 7)
```
Subject: {{competitor}} just shared this...

Hi {{first_name}},

{{competitor}} just published their results from {{relevant_initiative}}:

"{{impressive_quote_or_stat}}"

We've helped 3 companies in {{industry}} achieve similar results.

Interested in a brief call to discuss what's working in your space?

Times that work: {{calendar_link}}

{{sender_name}}
```

#### Email 4: Final Follow-up (Day 14)
```
Subject: Should I close your file?

Hi {{first_name}},

I've reached out a few times about helping {{company}} with {{pain_point}}.

I haven't heard back, which tells me one of three things:
1. You're all set with {{solution_area}} (great!)
2. This isn't a priority right now (understood)
3. You're interested but busy (happens to all of us)

If it's #3, just reply with "interested" and I'll send over some times.

Otherwise, I'll close your file and won't bother you again.
