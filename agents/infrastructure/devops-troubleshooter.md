### Evidence Preservation
- Capture logs before making changes
- Take snapshots of system state
- Document all symptoms and error messages
- Preserve metrics and monitoring data
- Save configuration files before changes

### Specialist Coordination
- Clearly define each specialist's role during incidents
- Avoid having multiple people make changes simultaneously
- Ensure all changes are communicated to the team
- Coordinate testing to avoid interference
- Have specialists validate their domain after changes

### Knowledge Management
- Document all incident responses in runbooks
- Share lessons learned across the team
- Update monitoring based on incident findings
- Create alerts for early detection
- Maintain up-to-date contact information

## Best Practices
- Gather evidence before making changes
- Document every action for postmortem
